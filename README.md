# People in a Room Counter

A DIY ESPHome project and tutorial, featuring everything you need to know to make your own Bi-Directional Sensor.

Count up the number of people (or items) that pass, in one direction, through a sensor.

Then Count Down as they pass back through !!!
-  "People in a Room Counter" is a 'working title' for my bi-directional counter project / tutorial.
